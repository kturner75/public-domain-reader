## Discovery Epics (Pending Product Discussion)

### BL-018 - Personalized Landing Page Rework
- Type: Improvement
- Priority: P1
- Effort: L
- Status: Discovery
- Problem: Current library landing does not adapt to reading behavior or intent.
- Scope Buckets:
- Personalization model (continue reading, streaks, recommended next action).
- Information architecture for library/recents/discovery sections.
- Lightweight ranking logic using local activity signals.
- Discovery Questions:
- Should the landing page prioritize "continue reading" over exploration?
- What activity dimensions matter most (recency, completion, pace, favorites)?
- Should this personalization be local-only initially or account-backed later?
- Current Direction (2026-02-08):
- Move from generic catalog landing to reader-activity-driven sections:
- User library (books started or explicitly saved).
- In progress.
- Completed.
- Up next queue.
- Keep a discovery rail for new books so exploration remains visible.
- Exit Criteria for Discovery:
- Ranked section model with tie-break rules.
- Approved landing page layout and interaction flow.

### BL-020 - Post-Chapter Pop Quiz
- Type: Feature
- Priority: P2
- Effort: M
- Status: Done
- Problem: Readers may want optional chapter-level comprehension checks and reflection prompts.
- Implementation Plan:
- Phase 1 (Data + API): Add per-chapter quiz persistence with immutable payload storage, generation status, and read/status/generate/grade endpoints.
- Phase 2 (Generation Pipeline): Implement async on-demand quiz generation on chapter load with LLM JSON output and extractive fallback.
- Phase 3 (Reader UX): Add `Quiz` tab in chapter pause overlay with multiple-choice flow, score summary, and wrong-answer citation snippets.
- Phase 4 (Progression): Define difficulty ramp and trophy linkage once quiz completion telemetry is stable.
- Current Direction (2026-02-08):
- Start with factual-only quizzes.
- Present at chapter pause as optional interaction.
- Add citations/snippets for wrong answers as a likely v1 requirement.
- Current Direction (2026-02-11):
- v1 quiz format: factual-only multiple-choice (target 3 questions, allow 2-5 from LLM output).
- v1 generation mode: on-demand async generation with persisted chapter quiz payloads and cache reuse.
- v1 review feedback: grading response includes correct answer and citation snippet for each missed question.
- Acceptance Criteria:
- Quiz API returns stable, static payload for a chapter after first successful generation.
- Quiz grading endpoint returns total score and per-question correctness with citation snippets for missed answers.
- Reader chapter pause UI exposes quiz interaction without blocking continue/skip chapter navigation.
- Quiz difficulty ramps deterministically by chapter progression and returns current difficulty in quiz payload/grade responses.
- Quiz grading records progression attempts and unlocks deterministic quiz trophies for future gamification surfaces.
- Work Tracker:
| Slice | Status | Scope | Done When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BL-020.1 Quiz Data + API | Done | `chapter_quizzes` persistence, async generation queue, `/api/quizzes` status/read/generate/grade endpoints | Controller/service tests pass and generated quiz payload is stable per chapter |

- 2026-02-11: Completed BL-020.3 by adding chapter-index-based quiz difficulty ramping, persisted quiz attempt/trophy tracking, trophy/readout APIs, and UI feedback for unlocked trophies and streak progress.

### BL-021 - User Registration and Account System
- Type: Feature
- Priority: P1
- Effort: XL
- Status: Discovery
- Problem: User-specific progress and personalization cannot reliably persist across devices without accounts.
- Scope Buckets:
- Authentication and session architecture.
- User data model migration from local-only state.
- Privacy/security controls and account lifecycle operations.
- Discovery Questions:
- What auth modes are required at launch (email/password, OAuth, magic link)?
- What existing local data should be migrated into new accounts?
- Is anonymous mode still supported alongside registration?
- Current Direction (2026-02-08):
- Cost and traction uncertainty are primary constraints.
- Registration remains discovery-phase and should be sequenced after validating engagement loops.
- Any account approach must include cost controls and staged rollout.
- Exit Criteria for Discovery:
- Auth architecture decision record.
- User data ownership and retention policy.
- Minimum viable account feature set and rollout plan.

### BL-022 - Reader Chapter Summary Feedback (AI Coach)
- Type: Feature

- Scope Buckets:
- Reader-written chapter summary capture UI.
- AI rubric scoring against chapter key points.
- Missed-point feedback with spoiler-safe guidance.
- Discovery Questions:
- Should this be optional after quiz completion or standalone?

## P0

### BL-001 - Secure and rate-limit generation/chat endpoints
- Type: Tech Debt
- Priority: P0
- Effort: L
- Status: Proposed
- Problem: Expensive endpoints (`tts`, `illustrations`, `characters`, `pregen`) are callable without auth/rate controls.
- Acceptance Criteria:
- Add authentication/authorization strategy for non-local deployments.
- Add per-IP or per-user rate limits for generation and chat endpoints.
- Add safe defaults when deployment mode is `public`.

### BL-002 - Replace in-memory generation queues with durable job orchestration
- Type: Tech Debt

- Acceptance Criteria:
- Jobs persist across application restarts.
- Retry/backoff policies are explicit and test-covered.
- Job status can be queried without scraping logs.

### BL-003 - Expand automated test coverage for AI/media pipelines
- Type: Tech Debt
- Priority: P0
- Effort: L
- Status: Proposed

- Acceptance Criteria:
- Adopt Flyway or Liquibase migrations.
- Restrict seed data to explicit dev/test profiles.
- Add rollback-safe migration guidance.

## P1

### BL-005 - Add notes, highlights, and bookmarks

- Acceptance Criteria:
- Users can create/edit/delete highlights and notes per paragraph.
- Users can jump to bookmarks from a reader sidebar/modal.
- Data persists per book across sessions.

### BL-006 - Reader preferences panel (typography/layout controls)
- Type: Feature
- Priority: P1
- Effort: M
- Status: Proposed
- Problem: Font size/line-height/theme/column-gap are static in practice.
- Acceptance Criteria:
- Add preferences UI for typography/layout controls.
- Persist preferences and apply on load.
- Re-pagination remains stable after setting changes.

### BL-007 - Library management UI for local books and feature toggles
- Type: Improvement
- Priority: P1
- Effort: M
- Status: Proposed
- Problem: Backend supports delete and feature toggles, but UI lacks first-class controls.
- Acceptance Criteria:
- Expose delete/unimport action with confirmation.
- Expose per-book feature toggles in library UI.
- Reflect toggle state immediately in reader availability checks.

### BL-008 - Upgrade in-reader search quality and navigation
- Type: Improvement
- Priority: P1
- Effort: M
- Status: Proposed
- Problem: Snippets are fixed-length and ranking is generic; navigation context is limited.
- Acceptance Criteria:
- Improve snippet extraction around match location.
- Add optional chapter filter and result grouping.
- Highlight matched terms in displayed paragraph after navigation.

### BL-009 - Make pre-generation non-blocking with progress API
- Type: Improvement
- Priority: P1
- Effort: L
- Status: Proposed
- Problem: Current pre-generation endpoint blocks while polling and sleeps in-process.
- Acceptance Criteria:
- Start job endpoint returns job ID immediately.
- Progress endpoint reports counts/state/errors.
- Frontend or CLI can poll/cancel safely.

### BL-010 - Unify user-facing errors and retries
- Type: Improvement
- Priority: P1
- Effort: M
- Status: Proposed
- Problem: Frontend still relies on `alert()` and scattered error patterns.
- Acceptance Criteria:
- Replace blocking alerts with consistent toast/inline error components.
- Standardize retry affordances for import/search/generation failures.
- Map backend error payloads to clear UX states.

### BL-011 - Add observability for long-running generation flows

- Priority: P1
- Effort: M
- Status: Proposed
- Problem: Debugging relies mostly on logs; queue/backlog metrics are not first-class.
- Acceptance Criteria:
- Expose metrics for queue depth, success/failure counts, and processing latency.
- Add correlation IDs to generation requests.
- Add health detail endpoint for provider and queue status.

### BL-017 - Post-Chapter Recap + Discussion Experience
- Type: Feature
- Priority: P1
- Effort: XL
- Status: Done
- Problem: Readers need structured comprehension support between chapters without breaking immersion.
- Implementation Plan:
- Phase 1 (Data + Contracts): Add recap persistence model per `bookId/chapterId` with immutable generated payload, status, timestamps, and prompt/version metadata; add recap retrieval/status APIs and typed frontend response models.
- Phase 2 (Generation Pipeline): Implement hybrid generation path: pre-generate recaps during batch pre-generation for top-N books and generate on-demand fallback on first chapter completion for non-pre-generated books.
- Phase 3 (Reader UX): Add chapter-transition recap screen in `reader.js` with short default recap, expandable detail (key events + character deltas), and explicit continue CTA to next chapter.
- Phase 4 (Discussion Chat): Add chapter-bounded discussion endpoint that only uses text from chapters `<= currentChapterIndex` and recap payload for context; persist thread locally like character chat.
- Phase 5 (Safety + Quality): Add spoiler and hallucination controls (context window hard cap, chapter index guard, refusal/fallback response); add regeneration only via explicit admin/CLI action so recap stays static for readers.
- Phase 6 (Rollout + Ops): Ship behind feature flag, enable first for pre-generated books, then expand to on-demand fallback after latency/error thresholds are met.
- Acceptance Criteria:
- Recap API returns consistent, static recap payload for a chapter after first successful generation.
- Recap payload includes short summary, key events, and character development deltas with structured fields.
- Pre-generation flow queues recap generation alongside existing pipelines and reports recap progress in status output.
- On-demand recap generation is triggered once per chapter when missing and does not block chapter navigation.
- Chapter discussion responses never reference content from future chapters and return a guarded fallback when request context is invalid.
- Reader UI shows recap between chapters with opt-out toggle and allows users to skip directly to next chapter.
- Feature can be disabled globally and per book without breaking existing reader flow.
- Dependencies:
- BL-009 (non-blocking pre-generation progress API) to expose recap generation state cleanly.
- BL-010 (unified error/retry UX) to handle recap/chat failures without `alert()` regressions.
- Existing character analysis/pre-generation queue patterns (`CharacterService`, `PreGenerationService`) reused for recap job orchestration.
- Risks:
- LLM cost/latency spikes from on-demand recap generation on long chapters.
- False-positive spoiler leakage if chapter-bound context checks are incomplete.
- Reader transition fatigue if recap interrupts users who prefer continuous reading.
- Rollout Notes:
- Start with recap format `short + key events + character deltas`; defer alternate formats (timeline/bullets variants) to follow-up.
- Default rollout: enabled for top-N pre-generated books only; on-demand fallback toggled on after one release cycle of metrics.
- Add instrumentation for generation latency, failure rate, spoiler-guard fallback rate, and recap view/skip rate before widening rollout.

- 2026-02-08: Updated recap overlay UX to auto-refresh while status is `MISSING/PENDING/GENERATING`, stopping polling once terminal status is reached or overlay closes.
- 2026-02-08: Refined recap overlay into two tabs (`Recap` default, `Chat`) to improve focus now and leave clean UI space for future `Pop Quiz` expansion.
- 2026-02-08: Started BL-017.5 by adding rollout gating modes (`all`, `allow-list`, `pre-generated`), per-book recap availability endpoint, and recap metrics capture (generation/chat/modal events) with status visibility.
- 2026-02-08: Added recap-specific reasoning provider config so recaps can use Ollama independently of other reasoning tasks (cost-control path for recap generation).
- 2026-02-08: Added recap-only pre-generation mode for batch runner to support top-20 recap generation without triggering illustration/portrait generation.
- 2026-02-11: Stabilized recap pre-generation by preventing duplicate queue entries, skipping already-completed recaps, and resetting only stale `GENERATING` recaps (plus configurable stall thresholds).
- 2026-02-11: Completed recap UX polish with persistent modal chrome + scrollable body, recap/chat tab flow polish, and a reader header control to re-enable per-book recap popups after opt-out.
- 2026-02-11: Hardened recap chat guardrails by enforcing source-only prompt behavior and chapter-scoped local chat history; validated behavior in manual QA on tested books.
- 2026-02-11: Marked BL-017 as Done; next feature work continues under BL-020 (Post-Chapter Pop Quiz).
